# Measurement Problems in Data Science

This document provides an academic overview of key measurement problems in data science, including rating products, sorting products, sorting reviews, and $A/B$ testing. Each section includes definitions, methodologies, and detailed examples.

## 1. Rating Products

### Definition:
Rating products involves aggregating user feedback to evaluate the quality or popularity of a product. The goal is to derive a meaningful score that reflects the collective opinion of users.

### Methods:
1. **Simple Average:**  
   The arithmetic mean of all ratings.  
   Formula:  
$\text{Average} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_i}{n}$  
   where $(R_i)$ is the rating and $(n)$ is the total number of ratings.

2. **Time-Based Weighted Average:**  
   Assigns higher weights to recent ratings to account for temporal trends.

3. **User-Based Weighted Average:**  
   Weights ratings based on user credibility or expertise.

4. **Weighted Rating (IMDB Formula):**  
   Combines the average rating with a minimum number of votes to ensure reliability.  
   Formula:  

   $WR = \frac{v}{v+m} \cdot R + \frac{m}{v+m} \cdot C$
     
   where:
   - $(v)$: Number of votes for the product.
   - $(m)$: Minimum votes required.
   - $(R)$: Average rating.
   - $(C)$: Mean rating across all products.

## 2. Sorting Products

### Definition:
Sorting products involves ranking items based on specific criteria to improve user experience and decision-making.

### Methods:
1. **Sorting by Rating:**  
   Products are ranked by their average rating.

2. **Sorting by Comment Count or Purchase Count:**  
   Products with more reviews or purchases are ranked higher.

3. **Bayesian Average Rating Score:**  
   Adjusts the average rating by incorporating prior knowledge to handle variability in the number of ratings.  
   Formula:  
$BAR = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (R_i \cdot W_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} W_i}$ 
   where $(W_i)$ is the weight for each rating.

4. **Bayesian Formula:**  
   A specific implementation of Bayesian scoring used by IMDB .  
   Formula:  
$WR = \frac{v}{v+m} \cdot R + \frac{m}{v+m} \cdot C$

## 3. Sorting Reviews

### Definition:
Sorting reviews involves ranking user reviews to highlight the most helpful or relevant ones.

### Methods:
1. **Up-Down Difference Score:**  
   Calculates the difference between upvotes and downvotes.

2. **Average Rating:**  
   Uses the mean of all ratings for a review.

3. **Wilson Lower Bound Score (WLB):**  
   A statistical method to calculate the lower bound of a confidence interval for a Bernoulli parameter $(p)$.  
   Formula:  
   $WLB = \hat{p} - z \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$ 
   where:
   - $(hat{p})$: Proportion of positive ratings.
   - $(z)$: Z-score for the desired confidence level.
   - $(n)$: Total number of ratings.

## 4. A/B Testing

### Definition:
$A/B$ testing is a statistical method to compare two groups (e.g., control and treatment) to determine if there is a significant difference between them.

### Steps:
1. **Hypothesis Formulation:**  
   - Null Hypothesis $(H_0)$: No difference between groups.
   - Alternative Hypothesis $(H_1)$: A significant difference exists.

2. **Sampling:**  
   Collect representative samples for both groups.

3. **Descriptive Statistics:**  
   Summarize the data using measures like mean, median, and standard deviation.

4. **Assumption Checks:**  
   - **Normality:**  
     Use the *Shapiro-Wilk* test to check if data follows a normal distribution.
   - **Variance Homogeneity:**  
     Use Levene's test to check if variances are equal.

5. **Hypothesis Testing:**  
   - **Parametric Test:**  
     Independent two-sample t-test if assumptions are met.
   - **Non-Parametric Test:**  
     *Mann-Whitney U* test if assumptions are violated.

6. **P-Value Interpretation:**  
   - $(p < 0.05)$: Reject $(H_0)$.
   - $(p \geq 0.05)$: Fail to reject $(H_0)$.
