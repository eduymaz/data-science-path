# Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Formulas

## CLTV Formula
```
CLTV = (Customer Value / Churn Rate) * Profit Margin
```
**Explanation:** The Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) is a critical metric in customer relationship management and marketing analytics. It represents the total revenue a business can expect from a customer over their entire relationship. By understanding CLTV, businesses can make informed decisions about customer acquisition costs and retention strategies. The formula calculates CLTV by dividing the Customer Value by the Churn Rate and then multiplying by the Profit Margin. This approach ensures that the profitability of each customer is accurately assessed.

## Customer Value Formula
```
Customer Value = Average Order Value * Purchase Frequency
```
**Explanation:** Customer Value quantifies the monetary worth of a customer to the business. It is determined by multiplying the Average Order Value by the Purchase Frequency. This metric helps businesses identify high-value customers and tailor their marketing efforts accordingly. A higher Customer Value indicates that a customer is more profitable, either due to frequent purchases or higher spending per transaction.

## Average Order Value Formula
```
Average Order Value = Total Price / Total Transactions
```
**Explanation:** Average Order Value (AOV) measures the average amount spent by a customer per transaction. It is calculated by dividing the Total Price by the Total Transactions. AOV is a key performance indicator for e-commerce and retail businesses, as it reflects the effectiveness of pricing strategies and upselling efforts. Increasing AOV can significantly boost overall revenue without requiring additional customers.

## Purchase Frequency Formula
```
Purchase Frequency = Total Transactions / Total Number of Customers
```
**Explanation:** Purchase Frequency indicates how often customers make purchases within a specific time frame. It is calculated by dividing the Total Transactions by the Total Number of Customers. This metric is essential for understanding customer behavior and loyalty. A higher Purchase Frequency suggests that customers are engaged and satisfied with the products or services offered.

## Churn Rate Formula
```
Churn Rate = 1 - Repeat Rate
```
**Explanation:** Churn Rate represents the percentage of customers who stop doing business with a company over a given period. It is calculated as one minus the Repeat Rate. A high Churn Rate indicates that a business is losing customers at a rapid pace, which can be detrimental to long-term profitability. Understanding and reducing Churn Rate is crucial for improving customer retention and lifetime value.

## Profit Margin Formula
```
Profit Margin = Total Price * 0.10
```
**Explanation:** Profit Margin is the percentage of revenue that remains as profit after all expenses are deducted. In this context, it is assumed to be 10% of the Total Price. Profit Margin is a vital metric for assessing the financial health of a business. It helps in determining the sustainability of pricing strategies and operational efficiency.
